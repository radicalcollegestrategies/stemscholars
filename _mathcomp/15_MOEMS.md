<li> Buy Vol 2 & 3 (not Vol 1) of MOEMS prep books 'coz they separate the problems into Div E & M</li>

<li><a id="moems">MOEMs is flexible about proctor / location. If your school doesn't offer MOEMs:</a>
<ul class="italicl2" style="padding-left:12px"> 
<li>Ask your teacher if you can put their name on the form. All they have to do is receive a packet on your behalf.</li>
<li>In the form, put the teacher's name as PICO, but the parent's email address</li>
<li>The parent can even hold the contest at home</li>
<li>The prize packet will be sent to the teacher at the school address around April. Be sure to collect it.</li>
</ul></li>
