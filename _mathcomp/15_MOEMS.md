<li> Buy Vol 2 & 3 (not Vol 1) of MOEMS prep books -- they separate the problems into Div E & M</li>

<li id="moems">MOEMS is flexible about proctor / location. If your school doesn't offer MOEMS:
<ul class="italicl2" style="padding-left:12px"> 
<li>Ask your teacher if you can put their name on the form. All they have to do is receive a packet on your behalf.</li>
<li>In the form, <u>put the teacher's name as official PICO, but the parent's email address
</u></li>
<li>The parent can even hold the contest at home</li>
<li>The prize packet will be sent to the teacher at the school address around April. Be sure to collect it.</li>
</ul></li>
