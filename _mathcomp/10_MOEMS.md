<li>Challenging but fun!</li>
<li>MOEMs is flexible about proctor / location. If your school doesn't offer MOEMs, convince a school teacher to register a team, and a parent can be the proctor and even hold the contest at home</li>
<li> Buy Vol 2 & 3 (not Vol 1) of MOEMS prep books 'coz they separate the problems into Div E & M</li>
