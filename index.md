    <h2>Our mission</h2>   
    <ul> Many students don't look at STEM because they don't know where to start. Our mission is to change that. </ul>
    <ul> This website should help you get started in any area of STEM, no matter what grade you're in. </ul>
    <ul> Of course, there are many more resources available out there than what we can list on 1 website, so once you're an expert in some fields, feel free to google for resouces in your specific area. </ul>
