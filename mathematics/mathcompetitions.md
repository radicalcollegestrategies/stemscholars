    <li>Math Competitions give you a syllabus of fun new math concepts to learn in a given timeframe</li>
    <li>The competitions help you build your thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
    <li>Some competition topics like combinatorics are not covered in depth in school, but are needed for a good Math foundation</li>
    <li>As a bonus, if you do well, you get to brag about it to your friends and in your college applications!</li>

<h2>Registering for the competitions</h2>
<div style="text-align:left">
  <ul class="disc16l1"> Different Math Competitions follow different formats:
    <li id="individual"><b>Register as an individual:</b> e.g. <a href="#kangaroo">Math Kangaroo</a>. All you have to do is find a Test Center that is holding the competition. This is useful if your school doesn't have a Math Club or Team. </li>
    <li id="flexible"><b>Register through the school, but flexible about the location or proctoring:</b> e.g. <a href="#moems">MOEMS</a>. If your school doesn't have a Math Club, you can form a team with some friends, and convince one of the parents to be the proctor.</li>
    <li id="school"><b>Strict registering/proctoring through school:</b> e.g., <a href="#league">Math League</a>. This works great by providing you a ready-made team if your school has an after-school Math program. If it doesn't, then you will need to convince a school teacher to hold the competition.</li>
    <li id="private"><b>Schools or private institutions can register:</b> e.g, <a href="#amc8">AMC</a>. If your school doesn't have a Math Team, you can join a <a href="https://mathcircles.org/find-a-math-circle/" target="_blank">local Math Circle</a> or a private Math institute, and participate as an individual or in a team through them.</li>

<h2>Which competition should I participate in?</h2>
<p>Browse our <mark><a href="#list">complete list of popular math competitions</a></mark>, or follow the guidelines here to find the competition that's right for you!</p>
</section50short>

<section50>
<h3>Lower Elementary School: Grades K-3</h3>
  <p>If you really want to do a math competition, then go for <a href="#kangaroo">Math Kangaroo</a>. Easy to register as individual, no need to find a team!</p>

<h3>Upper Elementary School: Grades 4-6</h3>
  <p>The idea of Math Competitions in Elementary School is to develop the passion for the deep thinking that goes into competition math, not to go win an international prize! Also, it's hard for little kids to understand large timeframes and to practice for a competition that's 4 months away. For this reason, we recommend competitions that hold multiple contests in a year. This keep the kids engaged in the competition and keeps their motivation level high.</p>

  <p><b>Deciding question:</b> Does your school offer <a href="#moems">MOEMS</a>? (<u>or</u>) Can you <a href="#pico">persuade a school teacher to be the official PICO</a> for MOEMS?</p>

  <div class="section50left"> 
  <h4>Yes!</h4>
  <p><b>Participate in <a href="#moems">MOEMS</a>.</b> It is a prestigious competition, and is fun and challenging at the same time.</p>
  <p><b>Optional:</b> In addition to MOEMS, you can consider participate in <a href="#kangaroo">Math Kangaroo</a>, which has similar syllabus. It is a prestigious international competition with a single contest.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section50right"> 
  <h4>No, I'm on my own</h4>
  <p><b>Participate in <a href="#cml">CML</a></b> as a "Home School". It is a good alternative to MOEMS.</p>
  <p><b>Optional:</b> In addition to CML, you can consider participating in <a href="#kangaroo">Math Kangaroo</a>, which has a single contest. It is a prestigious international competition, and is slightly more challenging than CML, so you may need extra preparation.</p>
  </div>
</section50>

<section50>
<h3>Middle School: Grades 6-8</h3>
  <p><b>Deciding question:</b> Do you want hardcode competition, or do you want to compete for fun?</p>
  <div class="section50left"> 
  <h4>I want to compete at state/national level!</h4>
  <p><b>Participate in <a href="#amc8">AMC8</a> and <a href="#mathcounts">MathCounts</a></b>. Both are prestigious and challenging competitions, and serious contentents will find them fun! The preparation of both competitions is similar, and the dates are far apart so they don't clash with each other. If your school doesn't offer them, you can participate in AMC8 at a <a href="https://mathcircles.org/find-a-math-circle/" target="_blank">local Math Circle</a>, and register as an individual in MathCounts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section50right"> 
  <h4>I love math, but don't enjoy hardcore competitions</h4>
  <p>Pick between <b>MOEMS and CML</b> similar to Grades 4-6.</p>
  <p><b>Optional:</b> In addition to MOEMS/CML, consider participating in <a href="#league">Math League</a> if your school offers it. It's a fun contest at just the right level - not to hard, not to easy.</p>
  </div>

</section50>

<section50>
<h3>High Schools: Grades 9-12</h3>
  <p><b>Deciding question:</b> Do you want hardcode competition, or do you want to compete for fun?</p>
  <div class="section50left"> 
  <h4>I want to compete at state/national level!</h4>
  <p><b>Participate in <a href="#amc10">AMC10/12</a></b> and go as far as you can. Many colleges ask for your AMC and AIME scores during admissions!</p>
  <p><b>Optional:</b> Consider participating in some <a href="#otherhigh">other high school</a> competitions depending on your interest and proximity to the venue. Each competition requires specific preparation that takes time away from your other activities, so pick judiciously.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section50right"> 
  <h4>I love math, but don't enjoy hardcore competitions</h4>
  <p><b>Participate in <a href="#league">Math League</a></b> if your school offers it. It's a fun contest at just the right level - not to hard, not to easy. The high school version has a series of 6 tests to keep you occcupied through the school year!</p>

  <p>Or, forget about competitions altogether, and enjoy <a href="/logic/">Logic Puzzles</a> in your spare time!</p>

<h3>Preparing for the competitions</h3>
<div style="text-align:left">
<p>If you just show up for any Math Competition without much preparation, quite likely you won't perform well. It takes months of to prepare well for elementary school competitions, and sometimes years to prepare well for middle and high school competitions.  
</p>
<p>Some tips:</p>
  <ul class="disc16l1">
    <li>Make this a designated extra-curricular activity where you dedicate some time every week to prepare.</li>
    <li>Several competitions in the same age group will typically have similar syllabus, so you can prepare for them simultaneously.</li>
    <li>If it's hard to motivate yourself to study, form a study-group of like-minded friends and meet regularly.</li>
    <li>Ask neighbors or try nextdoor.com to find a local middle/high school student to coach an elementary/middle school team. This is a win-win because the coach develops leadership skills and the students benefit from the coach's expertise. </li>
    <li>High school students can self-prepare using the material listed, or join a <a href="https://mathcircles.org/find-a-math-circle/" target="_blank">local Math Circle</a> or a private Math institute. This will boost up your motivation level and enable you to register for team-competitions through the institute.</li> <li><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/school" target="_blank">Art of Problem Solving</a> has several classes for all levels of Math Competitions.</li>
    <li> There are YouTube channels targetting various competitions. This may work well for you especially if you don't have a coach.</li>
    <li>In the weeks leading up to the competition, do several practice problems/exams for that specific competition.</li>
