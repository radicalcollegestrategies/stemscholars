<h2>What is Computer Science?</h2> 
<div class="section50left">
<p>Learning Computer Science or "learning to code" is synonymous with learning algorithms. An algorithm is a set of steps for a computer program to accomplish a task.  Algorithms can range from simple, like: </p>
<p style="font-style:italic;text-align:center;margin:0;">if ... then do ... else do ...</p>
<p> to complex ones like Google's PageRank to give you the most relevant results for your search queries.</p>

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>Coding is done using <a href="https://news.codecademy.com/programming-languages/" target="_blank">Programming Languages</a>. <i>"Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute."</i> When you code, you use the <i>programming language</i> to give these instructions in a logical sequence to the computer. Once you learn how to code, it's very easy to pick up new programming languages. So don't worry about learning too many languages - just learn the language you need, and focus more on the logic of programming!</p>
