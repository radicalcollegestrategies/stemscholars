<li class="li2">Implementing projects and games is a fun way to enhance your coding skills.</li>

<li class="li2">We highly recommend the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/python2" target="_blank">Intermediate Programming with Python</a> course by AOPS where you'll code fun games like MineSweeper and Checkers.</li>

<li class="li2">Here you will program the logic to play and try to win the 
game, which is different from "Game Design" where you design the user interface. </li>
