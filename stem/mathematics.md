<h2>Explore Math in Elementary School</h2>
<p>If you love Math, then we recommend going deeper with <a href="/mathematics/mathcompetitions/">Math Competitions</a> or Research, and exploring related areas like <a href="/stem/technology/">Logic and Programming</a>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Math Beyond School</h2>
<p>Math is already covered well in school, and if you have the interest, you can accelerate through the Math Curriculum to cover: </p>
    <ul class="disk16l1" style="padding-left:40px"> 
    <li>Middle School: Algebra, Geometry and maybe Algebra-2</li>
    <li>High School: Pre-Calculus, AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics,and even Multivariable Calculus or Linear Algebra (if your school offers them)</li>
    </ul>
 <p>We do not recommend accelerating any more than the roadmap laid out above because:</p>
    <ul class="disk16l1" style="padding-left:40px"> 
    <li>Many colleges only ask for classes taken in grades 10 and up, so don't "waste" an AP class by taking it in 9th grade</li>
    <li>The roadmap outlined above is sufficient for most popular math competitions</li>
    <li>If you are hungry for more math, we recommend that you go into the depth by exploring the Competition / Research aspect of it, instead of going through the subject faster. Keep reading for more.</li>
    </ul>

<p> Work with your school conselor on how to take online classes if you want to accelerate through your Math Curriculum at school. Several schools recognize courses offered by <a href="https://www.byu.edu/ target="_blank">BYU</a>. <a href="https://svhs.co/ target="_blank">SVHS</a> or <a href="https://www.ucscout.org/ target="_blank">UC Scout</a>, but each school may be different.</p>
<p>Remember, if your school won't accept an online course, then it's a waste of time because you'll just have to repeat the whole subject in school. For that reason, Khan Academy is great for reviewing any topics that were not covered (well) in school, but not for doing complete courses that are already offered in school.</p>
