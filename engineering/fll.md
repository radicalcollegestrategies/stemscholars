<p>The FIRST Lego League Challenge (FLL) has 3 parts that are discussed in detail on this page. Each part has equal weightage.</p>

<h2>Robot Game</h2>
<p>One key thing to keep in mind while building your robot is the design process. Anytime you are embarking on a new challenge or new task for your robot, it’s really important to go through this process as it ensures organized and good results. When building, it’s easy to get disorganized. The process below is a fool-proof way to get actual solutions:</p>

<p>1. <b><u>Define your problem</u></b>: Look at what exactly the task is. Are you having to lift an object? Are you going up a ramp? Are you moving an object from one place to another? These are all examples of the types of tasks you may face.</p>

<p>2. <b><u>Explore Ideas</u></b>: Try to explore different ways to solve the problem. This could be thinking of different gears, mechanisms, parts, wheels, etc. that you can use to complete the task. When you are doing this, the first step is to have everyone conduct some quick research. This is when you will try to see if there are any existing solutions to the task that you can improve on. Once all the members have done some quick research, you can come back together and brainstorm on which idea you want to go further in. Something very important in brainstorms is to remember your Core Values - ALL IDEAS ARE VALID!! Everyone should be encouraged to say ANY idea they have. These can be detailed, silly, or just a quick thought. When this is happening, there should be no criticism of the ideas. Have everyone say their ideas, and have one person record all the people’s ideas. Hopefully you have lots of ideas from your brainstorm to work with; the more the better! </p>

<p>3. <b><u>Develop Solutions</u></b>: Based on the brainstorming, the team members consolidate a few good ideas. Then, agree on one solution to go with.</p>

<p>4. <b><u>Construct and Test</u></b>: Prototype the solution that the team agreed upon. Have everyone tinker with the materials to create the solution. See how this goes, and start thinking of what adjustments can be made to your solution, but don't change anything yet!</p>

<p>5. <b><u>Evaluate Solutions</u></b>: Try to perform the task with the solution you constructed and see how it worked out. Did it actually complete the task? Are there any improvements you can make? Did something work/not work how you anticipated? This is the time to think critically about your solution.</p>

<p>6. <b><u>Improve</u></b>: Go back to Step 4 and fix everything you’d like to improve. Keep doing this until you have the desired result for your task.</p>

<h2>Innovation Project</h2>
<p>This part of the FLL tournament is one where it is crucial that you think extremely creatively. The goal is to really try and make something to help the world. Think big, but think smart! Just like the building portion, always be organized and strategic. The timeline on the project is more prolonged as it is done as one big project throughout the build season. Here is a process you can follow:</p>

<p>1. <b><u>Decide on a problem</u></b>:
Once again, brainstorm in the same manner given in the robot process above. Try to start local -- what issues does your community face?</p>

<p>2. <b><u>Explore Solutions</u></b>:
In this step, unlike the robot building, you will mostly be researching. Look at lots and lots of sources until you are sure every part of your solution is clear, and can actually work.</p>

<p>3. <b><u>Get verified by an expert</u></b>: Try contacting an expert in the field you are trying to tackle. This can give a lot more clarity, and people are usually glad to help out! Don’t hesitate to reach out, as long as you are polite and respectful. Run your Problem and Solution by them, and take their feedback. Try to incorporate their feedback into your solution.</p>

<p>4. <b><u>Build a Model</u></b>:
Try and see how you can model or demonstrate your solution. Is there an experiment you can conduct? A small prototype you can build? A live demonstration you can show your judge?<br>
Make sure when you do this, you do try and make it look nice. A model that works is good, but a model that works and looks professional is great!</p>

<p>5. <b><u>Present Solutions</u></b>:
This is where you can be very creative and have tons of fun! Do you want to create a Google Slides presentation? Film a really nice video of your whole process? Make a big poster? Direct a skit? Go wild on this one, but again make sure you are very clear in what your solution is, and present it in a manner that is appealing. You can even try and be funny here! Have a blast!! 
Make sure your team has plenty of time to practice your presentation. Write a script for everyone and have lots of practice rounds on how you will show your presentation to your judge. Be confident, and know exactly what you are talking about.</p>

<h2>FIRST Core Values</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">The 6 FLL Core Values are:</p>
<div class="row3" style="width: 600px">
<div>Discovery</div>
<div>Innovation</div>
<div>Impact</div>
<div>Inclusion</div>
<div>Teamwork</div>
<div>Fun!</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>These 6 core values are the most important thing to always keep in mind! You could have the highest robot run score and a killer project, but if the judges catch you not following the core values, your team will not advance to the next level.</p>
<p>As a team, you want to constantly display these values to create a positive environment for everyone. Mutual gain and having friendly competition are extremely important. Being rude to other teams, dissing them, sabotaging - there is zero tolerance for such behavior in any FLL competition. The goal is to learn, not win! It is also extremely important to be kind to other members of your team. When working on the Robot and the Project, remember to always be respectful of each other, welcome different ideas, and strive to have everyone feel included. </p>
<p>One thing to also keep in mind within your team is team spirit! Having team spirit makes the whole team have a uniform goal and vision, and unites all members. Having a team t-shirt, team cheer, and just a fun theme throughout are great ways to have fun and stay organized. Even having a team mascot is super fun! </p>

<h2>Some Useful Resources</h2>
<p>Watch other teams completing the tasks on YouTube. Take careful notes of what their robot does right and wrong. </p>

<h2>General Reminders</h2>
<ul class="disc16l1">
<li>The children should make all the decisions and do the work on the robot and the project. The coaches and the mentors are there just to teach them the skills and guide them.</li>
<li>Always keep your timeline in mind! Make deadlines for yourself to make sure everything gets done in time.</li>
<li>Have a goal to complete in every meeting</li>
<li>Keep the <a href="https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/first-game-changers/fll-challenge/Rubrics.pdf">Rubrics</a> in mind from early on to ensure that you're heading in the right direction.</li>
<li>Be very, very organized! This applies to every single thing. I recommend every member has a graphing notebook that they can use for documenting things for the team, and their own things, such as research notes. Take notes on everything - draw pictures, add descriptions, and title all your pages so that you can find them easily. </li>
<li>Always seek to improve! Don’t ever be disheartened by your results. Getting to solutions is a very tedious process, so you should never give up. In the end it will be worth it when at your competition, you get to see all your hard work in action and meet other teams too!</li>
<li>There will always be a time at the competition when your robot will go haywire and you'll get a near-0 score. Don't lose hope - remember that this happens to <i>everyone</i>. Take a deep breath, debug the problem, fix it, and try again in the next run.</li>
<li>Above all, have fun!!! Do not fight within your team, or with other teams. This is meant to only be a learning experience.</li>
</ul>
