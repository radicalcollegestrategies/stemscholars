<h2>Who should do Robotics?</h2>


  <div class="section50left">
<br>
<i>Everyone</i> should try robotics and see if they like it. <br> 

  <ul class="no"> Robotics is...
  <li>not just for nerds </li>
  <li>not just for "rich people"</li>
  <li>and definitely not just for boys</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Why should I do Robotics?</h2>
  <div class="section50left">
      <h3>Fun reasons ...</h3> 
    <ul class="disc" style="font-size: 16px;"> 
    <li>Robotics teaches you coding in a fun way</li>
    <li>Building the right robot and its attachments to perform a job involves creative thinking and exercises many parts of your brain </li>
    <li>It feels great to see the robot doing what you program it to do. It makes you want to do more and more!</li>
    <li>Robotics is a team activity, so you have fun with your friends while learning teamwork </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section50right">
      <h3>Robotics is the future of all jobs</h3> 
    Many high paying jobs <i>in all sectors</i> involve robotics:
    <ul class="disc" style="font-size: 16px;"> 
    <li>Self driving cars are robots! </li>
    <li>Soon your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9PoBAssw0">amazon delivery will be done by drones</a> </li>
    <li>Doctors use nano-robots to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QwyMWM0Jjg">diagnose and treat cancer</a>, and also to perform surgeries </li>
    <li>Drones fight fires and perform air strikes, saving human lives</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Which robot should I buy?</h2>
<div> Well, that depends on a variety of factors, like your budget, or do you have a coach available to guide you, or whether you want a multi-purpose robot that you can shape to your wishes. We recommend the following robots: </div>

<h2>Hmmm, do I really need to participate in a Robotics competition?</h2>
<div> There are several robotics competitions for all age levels. Why should you participate in them? Robotics competitions give you a goal to work towards while learning robotics. Without a competition, you will buy a robot, and maybe play with it for a few days or weeks, and then it becomes another “toy” lying around the house. A competition, on the other hand, gives you a framework that defines what size team to collect, what kind of robot to build, what missions to program the robot for, and what timeframe to shoot for. It makes robotics a lot more fun! You don’t have to shoot to win 1st place. Just enjoy the experience.
